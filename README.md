# dotfiles

These are the config files for my current Arch setup:
* WM: i3
* Bar: polybar
* Terminal: kitty
* Shell: zsh
* Finder: rofi
* Text editor: vim

Note: this was written for an XPS 13 9370 running Arch Linux on a 4k screen; I haven't made any effort to ensure portability (yet), so much of this might be broken. Also, I haven't bothered to write an install script either. Sorry.


## Before install 
In case you forget how to sync these files, here's the symlink syntax:

```
ln -sv ~/projects/dotfiles/.filename ~
```

## To Do:
- [ ] Symlink my current dotfiles on laptop to these
- [ ] Create basic install script
- [ ] Refactor dotfiles to ensure portability
